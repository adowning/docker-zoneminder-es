# zmdockerfiles
This repository contains the Docker files used for our build system, and it also contains Docker files for running ZoneMinder.

Contributions are welcome, but please follow these simple guidelines:

- Only one Dockerfile per distro
- Keep each Dockerfile sorted by distro
- Each Dockerfile should be self sufficient. It should grab the ZoneMinder project (and other other requried files) from github or online resource rather than expect files to pre-exist on the filesystem.
